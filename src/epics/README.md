Epics
==========
The epics folder contains implementations of redux-observable epics. These 
epics responds to "epic actions". These actions generally fire async events 
that may or may not update the redux store. 
[See the redux-observable docs for more details](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html)
